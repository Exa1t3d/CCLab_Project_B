                <h3 class="green">Family: </h3>
                <p>Philip belongs to the Sangheli alien species viral family. He is an extremely contagious virus who, instead of being dissolved by the Sangheli's macrophages, instead disintegrates them on contact.</p>

            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Sangheli blood vessels.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Beause the Sangheli's immune system is incredibly adept at defending against intruders, Phillip clandestinley enters their bloodsreams by not deploying his viral spikes so that no antibodies can block his ports of entry. It's only after first contact with their macrophages that he shows his true form, and by then, it's too late. Because Phillip changes color upon every new contact, the Sangheli's have no viable option of defense, despite their renowned immune system, making Phillip an infamous creature throughout the galaxy. </p>

                Phillip might just be the most feared creature in the galaxy. His ability to inflate any species's immune system without detection is beyond frightening to all who inhabit the galaxy, even the Sangheli's, who are immune to all other types of infection. There have been attempts to wipe him off the face of the universe, most notably in 2218, when the Sanghelis formed a coallition with the Koloma, Hiro, and human species to rid the world of Phillip for once and for all. Despite their combined power, they were no match for Phillip, and their actions resulted in untold amounts of pain and suffering, even causing a galaxy-wide extension of the Koloma. From then on, the universe learned its place and instead opted for a volontary sacrifice system where every year, each species offers millions of its own to please Philip in all his glory.
